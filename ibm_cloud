IBM Cloud Private : an application platform for developing and managing on-premises, containerized applications. It is an integrated environment for managing containers that includes the container orchestrator Kubernetes, a private image registry, a management console, and monitoring frameworks.

IBM Cloud Private is a private container as a service (CaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud platform

IBM uses open sources components Kubernetes deployments to place instances of applications, which are built into Helm charts that reference Docker images.
The Helm charts contain the details about your application, and the Docker images contain all the software packages that your applications need to run

ADVANTAGES :

1. Robust monitoring and logging with ELK stack -> IBM Cloud Private uses the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack and Filebeat. This monitoring and logging process provides a centralized store for all logs and metrics, better performance, and increased stability when you access and query logs and metrics

Kibana/Grafana can be used to query the data in Elasticsearch database

2. Security
3. Metering
5. Monitoring and alerts

Helm

Helm, the Kubernetes native package management system, is used for application management inside an IBM Cloud Private cluster

IBM Architecture
 cluster has four main classes of nodes: boot, master, worker, and proxy.
 Boot node is used for running installation,confgiuration,node scaling and so on.
 Only one boot is required for any cluster or multiple cluster. Each cluster have it own master node 
 
 MASTER NODE - 
 1.A master node provides management services and controls the worker nodes in a cluster. Master nodes host processes that are responsible for resource allocation, state maintenance, scheduling and monitoring.
 
 2.High availability (HA) environment contains multiple master nodes, if the leading master node fails, failover logic automatically promotes a different node to the master role. Hosts that can act as the master are called master candidates.
 
 Worker Node - node that provides a containerized environment for running tasks
 
 Proxy Node  - node that transmits external request to services created inside cluster. Porxy node is required for load balancing
 
 Management node -> optional node that only hosts management services such as monitoring, metering, and logging
